These tables are used for integration. The 1st column contains the position info and the 2nd column contains the corresponding weight info.

Note that with certain symmetries integration can be made faster. For example, with eta_s->-eta_s symmetry, we only need to integrate the positive range of eta_s, and the integration of the negative side is carried out by making the weight column twice as large. The eta_gauss_table_10/15.dat are tables with such symmetry, and you can check that their weight column sums up to 8 ([-4,4]).
